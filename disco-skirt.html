          <p>The sewing process:</p>
        </div>  
        <div class="content" id="process-info-ds">
          <p>I followed a simple tutorial, and cut 2 pieces of fabric- a front and a back.  The pieces were just 2 rectangles with a little shaping to account for the fact that my body is not a rectangle.   To put it all together, I sewed up the side seams, cut my elastic, pinned it to my inside-out skirt, and folded the fabric over twice and sewed it in place to form a waist band. Finally I "stitched in the ditch" which is a fun phrase for sewing the elastic waistband to the fabric at the seams of the project, to reduce the amount that the elastic will roll over and get tangled inside the project. I have sewed many a crust waistband in my lifetime, but as a result, this one turned out pretty cute.</p>

            In many ways, this project was easy-peasy (to ME- but we all learn new skills differently).  This fabric is very fun, but the foil squares on the front definitely ~bothered~ my needle which moved around a bit, particularly when going along the curved edges of the side seams. To be honest I’m just happy it didn’t break.</div><div><br><div class="ll-title"> 
            Life Lesson #129- Hemming and Hawing on Hemming is okay by me</div><br>
            For the curious, who may have noted a key missing step, I decided not to hem this skirt, because frankly, the edge does not did not look raw, and I don’t anticipate a lot of fraying due to the foil squares. Although time will tell if that was a mistake!</div>
