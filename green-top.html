          <h2>The sewing process:</h2>
        </div>  
        <div class="content">
          <p>After fabric prep (washing to get it to shrink and ironing to get out wrinkles), I cut the pieces of my pattern. Then I did a lot of sewing pieces together- the back pieces to each other, the front pieces to eachother, adding in the cups, and doing up the side seams. Next, I made some spaghetti straps by sewing up the long edge of two thin strips of fabric to make tubes.  To turn my "tubes" into straps, I used the string method- which basically involves sewing a piece of string to one end of the outside of the strap and pulling it through the tube then removing it.  Which let me tell you, takes a healthy dose of patience!! Next, I sewed the facing of the top along the top edge of the garment (inserting the straps into the seam.  I added an invisible zipper to the remaining open side seam, finished the rest of that seam, and finalized the project by hemming the bottom of my top!

          <h3 class="ll-title">Life Lesson #92- Measuring is a serious business</h3>
          <p>I also learned to TEST OUT THE LENGTH OF MY STRAPS before sewing on the facing to any future tops because these ones are way too long.  Fortunately, this is nothing a well placed safety pin can’t fix!  That's actually my life motto.</p>
          <br><h3 class="ll-title">
          Life Lesson #37- For goodness’ sakes Maddy,  just buy a new bobbin</h3>
          <p>For this project, I decided not to change the thread I had on the bobbin in my machine. Why, you may ask? My machine is pretty old, and I don’t own many compatible bobbins since they’re hard to track down.  This ended up being a stupid idea because my thread was black, my top is not, and I ended up having a ROUGH time sewing in my invisible zipper on this one so the seam looks pretty messy.  You live and you learn ...to pay more attention to the invisible zipper video tutorial you’re watching ;).</p>
