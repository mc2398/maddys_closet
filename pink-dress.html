          <h2>The sewing process:</h2>
        </div>  
        <div class="content">
          <p>After fabric prep (washing to get it to shrink and ironing to get out wrinkles), I cut the pieces of my pattern.  Next I quickly sewed the dresses’ back pieces together, and the front pieces together (which entailed easing the seams, around the curved edges in the front to make sure they were not pointy).  After sewing up the side seams, I attached the facing to the top of the dress- this takes care of the raw edge at the top of the dress.  Finally I sewed in the invisible zipper in the center back seam and finished the seam (spoiler alert- this was an absolute mess), BUT I decided to just hem the whole dress and call it a day!</p>

          <h2>Life lessons I learned along the way:</h2>

        <div class="content">
          <h3 class="ll-title">Life Lesson #21- Zippers are Hard…</h3><p>The fun part of making this dress was in large part trying out making princess seams (and to be honest, I impressed even myself). Plus the fabric was easy to work with- maybe because it's really meant for furniture (oops).  But I learned that I REALLY don’t know how to sew an invisible zipper.  For those of you not "in the know" invisible zippers are the kinds you'll often find in your fancy clothes- dresses, tops with no visible zipper teeth. It’s harder than it looks! To be honest, I eventually gave up and decided to just rock the messed up zipper (or more accurately, I decided to wear a sweater over it).</p><h3 class="ll-title"><br>Life Lesson #99- …and so is fit.</h3><p>This project also taught me the importance of really testing the fit and not being afraid to modify a pattern - the dress is a bit too big on me up top for my taste.  But trying out a pattern with a muslin model and editing the pattern takes time, so maybe I should address my tendency towards hobby procrastination first!</p>
